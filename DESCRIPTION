Title: Compares R2 Value of Different Metabolite Imputation Methods
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Pipeline to calculate and compare R2 values of different imputation methods. Starts with specified correlation matrices and up to 3 factors. Then generates metabolite data according to factor model and correlation. Some amount of metabolites are removed. Missing data is imputed with MICE and then factor analysis is run with 1-4 factors. At the end produces a data frame which compares the R2 value of each metabolite by factor and method. Methods examined are: ignoring study heterogeneity, MICE, MICE and factor analysis  with 1-4 factors, and true correlation.
